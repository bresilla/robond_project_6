    For the navigation stack to work as intended (described above), the AMCL algorithm had to be implemented. The	AMCL algorithm has many configuration options that will affect the performance of localization. The	 min_particles 	and	 max_particles 	parameters	set	the	minimum	and	maximum	number
    of	particles	that	are	allowed	for	the	algorithm.	With	more	particles,	you	get	more	accuracy,
    but	this	increases	the	use	of	the	CPU.
    The	 laser_model_type 	parameter	is	used	to	configure	the	laser	type.	In	our	case,	we	are	using
    a	 likelihood_field 	parameter	but	the	algorithm	can	also	use	beam	lasers.
    The	 laser_likelihood_max_dist 	parameter	is	used	to	set	the	maximum	distance	for	obstacle
    inflation	on	the	map,	which	is	used	in	the	 likelihood_field 	model.
    The	 initial_pose_x ,	 initial_pose_y ,	and	 initial_pose_a 	parameters	are	not	in	the	launch
    file,	but	they	are	interesting	because	they	set	the	initial	position	of	the	robot	when	 amcl 	starts;
    for	example,	if	your	robot	always	starts	in	the	dock	station	and	you	want	to	set	the	position	in
    the	launch	file.
